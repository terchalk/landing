# nodejs blockchain barebones client #

## Getting Started ##
This application demonstrates the basics of getting started with the Mastercard Core Blockchain API. To get started you should take the following steps 
 * Clone this repository
 * Edit the message.proto file and assign your APP_ID for value of package
 * Goto Mastercard Developers and create a Mastercard Blockchain project (note this is currently a private API and you may need to request access). You will be taken through the wizard to create a node. You must provide an APP_ID and a protocol buffer definition i.e. message.proto.
 * You will receive a p12 file and a consumer key from Mastercard Developers for your project.
 * Execute the following commands
```bash
npm install
node app.js
```
When started it gets you to confirm your parameters and then displays a simple menu.
